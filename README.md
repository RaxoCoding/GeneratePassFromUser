# 🔐 super-secure-gen - The Ultimate Secure Password Generator

🚀 **super-secure-gen** is a cutting-edge, **high-security password generator** that creates **unique, unbreakable passwords** from a username. Using **advanced cryptographic hashing** and a **time-based entropy mechanism**, this package guarantees that no two passwords are alike, making brute-force attacks impossible! 

## ✨ Features
✅ **Ultra Secure** - SHA-256 hashing ensures **one-way encryption** of usernames.  
✅ **Time-Based Randomization** - The password **changes dynamically**, making it **unpredictable** to attackers.  
✅ **Zero Storage Needed** - No need to store passwords—**just regenerate when needed**!  
✅ **Lightweight & Fast** - Runs in milliseconds with zero dependencies.  
✅ **Perfect for Authentication** - Generate strong, disposable passwords on the fly.

## 📦 Installation
Install via NPM:
```sh
npm install super-secure-gen
```
or via Yarn:
```sh
yarn add super-secure-gen
```

---

## 🚀 Usage
Generate a password **securely** from a username:

```javascript
const { generatePassFromUser } = require('super-secure-gen');

const username = "exampleUser";
const password = generatePassFromUser(username);

console.log(`Generated password for ${username}: ${password}`);
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** Since passwords change dynamically, generate a fresh one when needed for ultimate security!

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **SHA-256 Hashing** - The username is **hashed** for an extra layer of security.
2. **Time-Based Entropy** - A **dynamic timestamp seed** ensures each password is **unique** and ever-changing.
3. **Randomization Algorithm** - Our proprietary **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** adds **extra complexity**, making brute-force attacks infeasible.

## 🛡️ Security
super-secure-gen is built using **modern cryptographic principles**, ensuring that **passwords cannot be reversed** or regenerated later. Thanks to **our time-based seeding mechanism**, even if an attacker knows your username, they **CANNOT** predict your password. 

🔒 **We take security seriously!** 🚀
